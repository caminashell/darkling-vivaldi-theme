# Darkling Vivaldi Theme

![Example 1](./assets/example.png)

Style inspired by the (discontinued) Opera Crypto Design Language (which used to be my web browser of choice), some personal preferences, an original Vivaldi background image[^1], and icons ported from the Issuna built-in theme.

> [!NOTE]
> Vivaldi is in my opinion the most highly customisable and performant privacy web browser I have discovered to date. Even though it uses Chromium under the hood, I do not have too much quarrel with it since it is open source. The Vivaldi project is open source to a degree[^2] [^3], but for me it isn't too hard to examine, use, and report on. I thoroughly enjoy the Vivaldi web browser experience, as a user, and as a developer.

> - The logo at the top right in the preview is my (old) profile image, and nothing to do with the theme.
> - Since this is just the theme, you may have to adjust your toolbars and other settings to achieve the results in the examples above.
